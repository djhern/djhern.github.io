        <p>
            My college education began at Butte College in Oroville, California. At the age of thirteen, I was enrolled
            into my first college class. After completing my college general education, I transferred to California
            Baptist University in Riverside, California. Here, I am majoring in computer science and am interested in
            the field of cybersecurity.

        <p>

            GradChain is a web application that I have been developing with a team as a school project. <br>
            Utilizing blockchain technology to cryptographically verify documents, GradChain allows
            universities to upload student diplomas for convenient verification. Employers searching for candidates can
            then view a student’s diploma or credentials through the website, knowing each document is authentic and the
            candidate is qualified.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <img class="ipfsimage" src="./images/ipfs.png" alt="IPFS">

        <p>
            The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is essentially a blockchain database that stores files as fragments of
            data on thousands of devices and retrieves the file by rebuilding each fragment through a Content Identifier
            (CID). By uploading a file to IPFS, GradChain can verify the untampered and genuine nature of the file for
            the employer.

        <p>
            TryHackMe is an online platform that provides users with a simulated virtual environment to practice and
            learn about cybersecurity and hacking. The platform offers various interactive and gamified cybersecurity
            challenges and training modules that cover a wide range of topics, including penetration testing, web
            application security, digital forensics, cryptography, and more.<br><br>

            In 2021, I ran a blog in which I completed a TryHackMe room a week for ten weeks. The button below will take
            you to this website.

        <p>
            The National Cyber League (NCL) is a biannual cybersecurity competition that provides participants with
            hands-on experience in real-world cybersecurity scenarios.<br><br>

            I competed in the 2021 fall competition. This competition provided me with experience in cryptography,
            network traffic analysis, enumeration, and web application exploitation.
